/*Activity 
onCreate() we will do UI binding part,we define the views here, first method called when an application runs
setContentView() sets the XML file pass layout as parameter
onStart() almost similar to onCreate .....slight difference between the two
onResume() ....both executed in one go
between the onResume() and onPause() is the activity runs
onPause is opposite of onResume()
onStop() is opposite of onStart()
onDetroy() is opposite of onCreate()
when the notification comes you go to onPause()
when user returns to the activity then onResume()
the activity no longer visible then onStop()
if you don't want to return to the activity then onDestroy()
else onStart()
